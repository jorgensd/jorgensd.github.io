  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    container: dokken92/pygmsh-6.6.1:pygmsh-env

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
