# How to modify these files

The src of the code is built using [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
With jupytext, you can modify the ipynb/py file, and the other files will be updated.

To do so, install `jupytext`
```bash
pip3 install jupytext
```

When using [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you can link the 
notebooks to automatically sync to `md`/`py` files when modifying the notebook, look [here](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#jupytext-commands-in-jupyterlab) for more details.
