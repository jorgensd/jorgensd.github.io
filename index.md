# About me

I am currently employed at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/people/dokken) as a Senior Research Engineer.
I am also one of the administrators of the [FEniCS Discourse forum](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/) and I am member of the [FEniCS Steering Council](https://github.com/FEniCS/governance/blob/master/governance.md#steering-council).
My focus is on finite element related software, usually extensions to the FEniCS project, or applications where FEniCS is employed.

## Software

I am involved in the development of the following software:
![The FEniCS logo](assets/img/fenics_logo.png){: .image-right }

- [The FEniCS project](https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/) - An open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations using the finite element method.
  End-user and core development resulting in the following papers, software and preprints

  - [DOLFINx: The next generation FEniCS problem solving environment](papers.md#dolfinx2023preprint)
  - [FEniCSx_ii: FEniCSx trace - A module for non-conforming 3D-1D coupling](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/fenicsx_ii)
  - [SciFEM: Convenience tools and extensions to FEniCSx](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/scifem/)
  - [FEniCS-in-the-wild: Biomedical examples of FEniCS using wildmeshing](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/fenics-in-the-wild/)
  - [FESTIM: An open-source code for hydrogen transport simulations](https://festim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  - [A multimesh finite element method for the Navier--Stokes equations based on projection methods](papers.md#dokken2020navier)
  - [Shape Optimization Using the Finite Element Method on Multiple Meshes with Nitsche Coupling](papers.md#dokken2019shape)

- [Dolfin-adjoint](https://dolfin-adjoint.github.io/dolfin-adjoint/) - An algorithmic differentiation tool using [pyadjoint](https://github.com/dolfin-adjoint/pyadjoint) to differentiate FEM models written in [Dolfin](https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin/src/master/) and [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/). The contributions here have resulted in the following papers and preprints
  - [Automatic shape derivatives for transient PDEs in FEniCS and Firedrake](papers.md#dokken2020shape)
  - [dolfin-adjoint 2018.1: automated adjoints for FEniCS and Firedrake](papers.md#mitusch2019pyadjoint)
- [Scientific Computing @ Simula](https://scientificcomputing.github.io/) A web resource for best software practices for academics using Python
- [dolfinx_mpc](https://github.com/jorgensd/dolfinx_mpc) - An extension to DOLFINx supporting multi-point constraints (such as contact and slip conditions)
- [adios4dolfinx](papers.md#adios4dolfinx) - A checkpointing framework for DOLFINx


From 2019-2022 I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, working on the ASiMoV project with Chris Richardson and Garth N. Wells on the [ASiMoV](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FS005072%2F1#/tabOverview)-project.
The main goal of this project was to do the worlds first, high fidelity simulation of a complete gas-turbine engine during operation, simultaneously including the effects of thermo-mechanics, electromagnetics, and CFD.
My main focus during this project was contact mechanics, multi-point constraints and large scale simulations with MPI.

From 2016-2019 I took my PhD at Simula Research Laboratory on the subject of Shape Optimization with Finite Element Methods.
